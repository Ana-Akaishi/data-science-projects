    "# Brazilian Investment Funds Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project main objective is to map investment fund market in Brazil. Investment funds can trade in different types of assets, like financial products (stocks, options, debentures), real state or buying part of other funds. Each fund raises capital by offering quotas, this can be an ongoing process (open fund) or only one time offer (closed fund).\n",
    "\n",
    "The funds are created and managed by a financial institution (manager). Managers will also take care of all the paper work involving fund rules, which index should investors use as benchmark and general structure so a bank can issue the fund. The bank role is so ensure the fund is legit, has the paperwork in order and distribute the financial sheets so potential investor can buy a quota. This is a very efficient way to poll resources and diversify the risk for all parties involved.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we know what is an investment fund, and how is its structure, let's be curious about it:\n",
    "- How many funds are in the market?\n",
    "- What are the main assets traded? Financial? Real State? Credit?\n",
    "- Who are the big managers?\n",
    "- Who are the main issuers?\n",
    "- How was the market for the last years?"

    "To collect the data, I'll request directly from CVM website the zipfiles containing the [daily returns of financial funds](https://dados.cvm.gov.br/dataset/fi-doc-inf_diario). The main issue here, is that we have two types of repositories: (1) monthly zip files from the current year to 3 years ago (Y-3), (2) yearly zip file for older data. So in my study 2024,2023,2022 and 2021 will have monthly zip files, while [2020](https://dados.cvm.gov.br/dados/FI/DOC/INF_DIARIO/DADOS/HIST/) will have only one zip file with 12 csv files inside.\n",
