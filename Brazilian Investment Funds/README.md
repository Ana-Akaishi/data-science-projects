# Brazilian Investment Funds Overview

This project main objective is to map investment fund market in Brazil. Investment funds can trade in different types of assets, like financial products (stocks, options, debentures), real state or buying part of other funds. Each fund raises capital by offering quotas, this can be an ongoing process (open fund) or only one time offer (closed fund).

The funds are created and managed by a financial institution (manager). Managers will also take care of all the paper work involving fund rules, which index should investors use as benchmark and general structure so a bank can issue the fund. The issuer (usually a bank) will ensure the fund is legit, has the paperwork in order and distribute the financial sheets so potential investor can buy a quota. This is a very efficient way to poll resources and diversify the risk for all parties involved.

Now that we know what is an investment fund, and how is its structure, let's be curious about it:
- How many funds are in the market?
- What are the main assets traded? Financial? Real State? Credit?
- Who are the big managers?
- Who are the main issuers?
- How was the market for the last years?
- How funds were affected during the pandemic?
- What can I expect for the next months?

To answer those questions, I'm making this project using open data from financial institutions and regulators to analyze funds marketl. At the end of it, I'll test some machine learning models to see if I can predect funds behavior for future months. The project follows this pipeline:
